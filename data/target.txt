well i think air pollution is a pretty big problem right now and it's i mean i think it's a
and there's just things like for a i think that cars especially here in the united states are just a
and i think you know if you just totaled up i don't know any of the exact figures but all
right
and if you look at other countries like in the third world and stuff where people ride bikes and all
air quality is much better than ours just as a result of their lack of having cars like if you
hum okay well i mean also along the same lines i know that there's somebody i read one time about
uh-huh
right
okay
so how do you use your credit cards
oh we use them
for paying our gas
for paying
um-hum
but we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get
if there's a monthly or a yearly charge we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free
yeah that's me i won't use one that i have to pay an annual fee
yeah
oh
so you keep record of all the checks you write and all the credit card
yeah
and all the a t m transactions and everything and i've got a file for each of them and
uh-huh
how do you categorize these things that's what always sort of stumped me when i sat down to do it
i have a file box and each file has a little piece of paper on it and each file there
okay
how you doing
pretty good how many children did you say you had
i have three i didn't say i have three of them yeah two i have the girl is the oldest
wow you have three children boys girls
yeah well you're doing a lot better than i can i can't rattle them off like that i know my
my oldest son he's out seeing the world right now he's in australia at the present time
wow
so you don't get a chance to spend much time with him then until when he comes home
where i had a lot of things that i thought that i needed to do that were more important than
you know and we need you know better health insurance and you know
okay
right
yep
okay
well right now i'm just a student i only work part time but i i've work in the job force
uh-huh
forty hours is just too long you just don't have any time to do anything it seems like
saturday you get off but sunday you're getting ready for monday
i don't really i more
the people i wouldn't consider to be a threat at all
and i really don't feel much like the soviet union itself is a threat anymore i'm worried about them they're
tumultuous state right now with the kinds of adaptations that they're attempting to go through
so
i'm concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden
they're very large
and they could become very quickly a large financial burden as one more stepchild we have to carry around
yeah i think that's a real important aspect and that as the most the
oh really hum
they were beaten by a last minute three point shot
oh my gosh
and so it kind of opened things up a little bit they play brigham young university tonight
uh-huh
and i i'm pretty sure they really got a good team this year and i
do they do they traditionally have a good team or is this sort of an unusually thing
yes they do they usually they're usually the one or two in the in the wac conference and they're the
huh
oh my goodness well we're sort of sort of a general motors family i guess that's the way we were
and we were overseas for ti for a number of years and when we came back we suddenly find out
oh goodness
really
for you know they each had twenty one thousand miles or something like that and turns out that's a pretty
um-hum
then we've got an eighty six chevy spectrum that we bought new my daughter was a freshman in college when
uh-huh
and we've got a eighty four toyota that we bought used so we've got four cars for our five licensed
yeah
and if you don't want the light bulbs there's vitamins and if you don't want the vitamins there's the household
pens
boy they they're tugging on a few strings at once aren't they
yeah they were bugging me for a donation earlier and i you know i get these calls on one line
yeah
and you know you it's i've learned to hang up on them but sometimes it's not so easy
yeah i got some call last night i'm trying to remember oh this was like this is kind of an
i went to a wedding expo because i'm getting married and there are like you know these places where they
lee
lee okay lee
oh well i think ideally people should want to do that automatically and that they should want to do what
you know meshes with how they feel and what they're good at and they shouldn't be funneled into a mandatory
um-hum
oh well in that case i think what this country needs is a good mandatory program to
you know get people just thinking hey this is normal it's normal to do good you know to be civic
um-hum
hum
yes i am
i've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening and i thought well i'm
well i'm happy we got through
i am too well do you have any opinion on the subject
well i'm especially interested with what what's happening in the soviet union the move to
hm
is quite a remarkable
oh
accomplishment is that is that reported in the texas papers
oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my
uh-huh
i worked even when she was a baby
oh
and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to
uh-huh
right off of walnut hill and preston and it was a wonderful environment i just wish all kids if they
uh-huh
uh-huh i see
i listen to the radio but not
oh i see well that's that is one of the handicaps with both tv and
yeah
and radio if you're not available on the hour or half hour then you lose out on an awful lot
that is the washington post is that correct i have read that when we were in that area and it
right
um-hum
so what more do we need to discuss tonight that seems like a very short one
well i can discuss a lot of the news that we have but i feel that that's not part of
well lets see i suppose i could say i joy crocheting
gardening knitting
hiking
do you have a lot of spare time to do it in or is it something you kind of have
well it seems like i don't have time for them but i'm i don't work full-time or anything
um-hum
i sell avon and stanley products
um-hum
but it's that's not
okay what exactly we're talking about industries trends everything
social changes
well whatever i guess you want to whether things changed over the last twenty years
okay
all right we'll start twenty years back and come forward how's that sound
all right good enough here we go
all right
well let's see i guess some of the some of the things civil rights have come a long way i
well yeah i think they have i really do and it's no longer the issue it once was and i'm
oh okay
we're discrete well are not discrete electronic devices
oh
oh and did he is he the one that got you connected with us
uh-huh
hum okay it's a lot of fun
yeah
you want to punch the button and go
sure you ready
well do you have any children or are you in college
mine well mine are grown and of course i've already been through this with them
and i guess i'll have to help with grandchildren one of these days i hope
certainly and where did your children go to college
well that's great
and one of them ended up at el centro in one of the specialized programs and another one is putting
i see
well that's great i'm the director of admissions at utd
well
good
yes we do right here at the at the very building they have a nurse's office
uh-huh
and i haven't
my name hasn't come up yet how about you
yeah i have what i've found out of curiosity was my name has come up twice and we've only been
right
and when i when i first heard about it i was very defensive i didn't think it was something that
right
well i several years ago a radio broke in my car and i never i got out of the habit
um-hum
too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they're in the news or something but so i
um-hum
songs that were popular back when i was paying attention and then i like some classical music and some of
um-hum
pieces that have been around a while i haven't paid much attention to most of the current music what about
i listen i listen to a wide variety of music sometimes i'll turn on the classical music sometimes i'll listen
um-hum
oh that's a very interesting question the answer that i have is no in fact i was selected for jury
uh-huh
um-hum
i had already changed jurisdictions and so i had to reply that i couldn't do it
right
i just recently retired from the army and so when we moved to this area here i got selected for
was it civil or criminal
this was all civil
although i did have a chance at a criminal one they actually had to interview like about a hundred and
i wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing
oh i
quite frequently glance through headlines or in the newspaper
but primarily mine is tv news
how about yourself
pretty interesting yeah i have to have to agree with you
normally don't have time in the morning to watch the any type of tv usually catch it going to work
true
we have a one year old in the house so it's kind of hard sometimes to watch tv during the
because it seems like and i'm thinking of the of community of people that are in jail now i think
if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some
that's true um-hum i agree with you in the sense that i think that it's important for people to also
uh-huh
right
and i think that there's too much
in the in a way of like self-gratification today
um-hum
and there's not enough sharing
yes
with the economy and with the dysfunctional families
yes
yes but i think it causes a lot of dysfunction in the family
women going out to work
possibly you know if they're doing it simply
for the money
if it's something that they need to fulfill themselves then that's something different too
yeah
and then the first thing that was done was after we found him guilty
his attorney jumped up and started going through the you know routine for filing an appeal
which you know i know that that's the right but the defendant but i mean it makes you wonder why
so i don't know that it was a little bit disgruntling to me
it
right i have never served on a jury i have been called like only twice in my life and
at the time i've been a legal assistant and nobody wanted me on their jury so i've been excused but
i don't know i look at the people who get excused and it's supposed to be a jury of your
right
professional computer
back in the days when ti was making computers that were similar to in terms of power to the ibm
the same stuff that we always have
yeah do you use computers at work or
well i used to i have a master's degree in computer science but i haven't i took a time out
uh-huh
six years ago when my first one turned a year old and
i see
so nowadays i'm teaching him at home and we're using the computer to drill him on math and to let
yes
well right now we have one dog inside
uh-huh
she goes out but i mean she's an indoor dog
yes
and two outside cats
oh gosh and how long have you had them
male and female
the dog's probably about thirteen fourteen years old and the cats are
well i have two children so i don't have a whole lot of spare time right now one of the
um-hum
uh-huh
i really enjoy i enjoy softball but i enjoy all kind of sports i enjoy watching and participating i really
yeah
and then i really enjoy sewing but i don't get much of a chance to just really sit down and
oh i like sports type things too we like to get out and walk and we like the water sports
uh-huh
i know it is do you work full time
oh well i'm not an expert i just had a little i've seen a little pollution in my time it's
that's really a pollution issue i think pollution issue is
is the argument over people catching things like respiratory disease
well there there's two things
the one i'm interested the most i guess myself
would be the freons i mean for air the one i guess that's the one i'm most curious about is
that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether when they replace it you know they're going to
yeah i was you know where they were all concerned about that but that it seems to be
well did you see carl sagan on sixty minutes on when he was talking about when if the if the
now i'm sorry excuse me
and i do that we recycle newspapers we take you know the dallas morning news daily and the plano paper
right
oh i know it builds up really fast
it really does i do recycle newspapers and glass
uh-huh
we don't really have enough plastic to mess with we don't you know like we don't drink milk and we
yeah we do we have two a two year old and a three year old and so it really builds
yeah
yeah well i was surprised that they had their people their own people in the survey but then why not
well i didn't realize that i thought all of it was ti employees in the survey i didn't i was
oh i see
do you know what they're doing with all this when they're finished
i am not positive i probably have gotten about the same information you have because i don't work anywhere even
um-hum
i know that once they get through with this i i've read where they're they may call certain people back
no i don't
oh you don't what they're what they're working on is the way i understand it is the computer system
well i have two cats
i have two cats because i can't have dogs where i live i i've wanted a dog i owned a
uh-huh
and you know our cats are very interesting and we never owned cats when i was growing up so this
it's been a really neat kind of learning experience for me they've blown all my preconceptions about cats
so do you do you have pets
yeah i have a dog and a cat
uh-oh do they get along
uh-huh
well the last vacation i went was to cozumel and that was last march and april
oh yeah
have you got another one planned
not at this point
although if we take another vacation i think we might like to go to cancun this time have you been
but also since my in-laws just moved to utah we're kind of pressured to go up there and go snow
i agree i mean if i'm going to go on vacation i want to lay out in the sun and
yeah
and someplace i'd like to go is like to the other side of the caribbean as you know as opposed
any particular reason that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you
oh it works fine it's just i think sometimes i you know you get busy you slack off a little
you know there's no more i mean you know then it's work to catch up
yeah
you know then the two or three times where i've got to the point i really needed one i created
and you do stick by it when you do it huh
yes how about you
well i tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is i list all my income coming in
hm
well the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so
oh yeah
i think a lot of it has to do with women working
uh-huh yeah i do too i think it's going to in like in the future i think all women are
yeah
yeah
but that will be it or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can
now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them they can't even afford
right
not very often i usually the ones we use is like visa and we always try to pay it back
huh-uh so it doesn't gets the credit
i have
right
interest rate is so high that you're really if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that
yeah
otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly
that's right
it's not a very good idea
well i think there's a big waste of our tax dollar
it does seem that way i was trying to think of whether we pay more tax now than we did
we don't we it there's too much
pocket stuffing going on as far as different companies contracting to do things for the county and
do projects for the state and you know course they prove that all the time on over the tv
uh-huh
you know
yeah it does seem like the special interest groups are what keeps taxes high
but i
varies i guess with where you are geographically if you're in an area where you got a lot to select
yeah
and i guess it'd depend on the age of the child the needs of the child how long the child
oh yeah
and we're in a situation where it's just one maybe two days a month at best so we're
well that's lucky
in only a couple of hours usually what we use them for now is to transport them between school and
yeah that's good
so it's nice to just have them there for the limited time frame but the
yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to high school
state school
okay but you're excluding high-level education
yes well yeah i am
actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there
okay
but it's the job that the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area
i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn't let them go to a public school system
okay
well i like to cook but i don't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because
hum-um
uh-huh
well yeah you can't enjoy it right
and so i don't like to arrive or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out so
yeah exactly
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh
remodeling project you undertook and if it was successful and you were pleased with what happened
well
you've been doing any remodeling lately
the only remodeling we do is we put new we put up molding and wallpaper and we put it up
uh-huh
front room
all right did you like the results
but i let the
yeah i don't do the actual
we seem to have a double standard in place over how we treat them countries down there for example
a left wing regime or communist regime is god awful and basically you know satan incarnate
while nations like for a long time el salvador and guatemala
with right wing regimes we kind of just winked at things like death squads and alike yeah we found nicaragua
right
and i just felt and it's the same thing with cuba that we really seem to have this kind of
whereas if your regime doesn't want to bother us a reason of threat to us we'll kind of ignore you
you can do whatever you want but if you invite the commies in you know look out
or if it doesn't even have to be commies if it's just a little left of what the prevailing attitude
okay well
maybe so far it's been enough it seems like it seems like
subjects
you know and allocated towards the aids research i think that aids research has been a lot of the funding
but i think the government is doing a good job so far
of keeping the their portion of the funding up
well i agree to an extent i think the problem is that
we're spending money and one of the things that the government likes to do when they're under public pressure is
um-hum
oh yeah i got three how about yourself
we have two and another one on the way
oh you've got young children then
well we yeah we do we have a our a six year old he's oldest and then our baby will
oh my goodness that's great
yeah
what kind of mix do you have a boy and a girl or
two boys two boys yeah
two boys
okay so do you have any favorite teams
well
not quite huh
made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but
well that's pretty good
anyway being in rochester you probably like the mets
yes i'm actually a met's fan i'm one of these people who's actually a
die hard met fan and an avid yankee hater
oh boy it the i think it's like one or the other isn't it i mean you either
okay well i think the court systems could stand some improvement
trial by jury is good but a lot of time it
in a lot of cases
is circumstantial evidence that convicts a person which i don't think is all the time good because
sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent
i mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have a eyewitness
and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me i don't know
so you think if trials were held by judges or experts that they would tend not to admit or not
i think so
from needlepoint to
anything in the hobby field as far as needlework is concerned
i've had to give it up recently because i've got problems with nerves in my right hand but basically it's
hum that sounds interesting
i have no love of yard work for hobby work though how about you
well my i've got some fairly bizarre but i do a lot of flying aerobatics for one
oh fantastic
oh
so but probably if i had to say my most favorite one was probably be flying
wall street journal or the new york times i don't subscribe to either but sometimes i get a hold of
however i do also watch television news usually in the morning once a day and i read the front page
oh that's interesting you said computer networks what sort i'm fairly knowledgeable about oh okay that's interesting
so it's no fee subscription i'm very easy to read at my leisure and it's sorted by category for example
i've never used the dow jones news wire
but yeah it do you do you get any do you read any news magazines or anything like that for
but not like business week or news week or one of those kinds of things i i'd like to say
interesting in what way in like in sort of like a quality or sort of the orientation in terms of
you well you won't offend me so go ahead and say
um-hum
caught his interview last night with david frost and it was the first time i had you know heard you
uh-huh
uh-huh
but the whole phenomena of him coming out of literally no where no party at least no apparent party support
huh
yeah i have not even heard believe it or not of that person i'm not kidding when you when you
um-hum
like out of nowhere yeah
drug testing policy not because of their own convictions but because the clients of our company are requesting that we
huh
how about you
no we're not being tested for drugs at all
our policies and procedures manual the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or
uh-huh
hum
okay
yeah
well let's see we or i sit down at the
in a on a monthly or a biweekly i get paid every two weeks so i make out a budget
i sit down and see how much money i have to have for my bills going out
and then i compare that to how much money we need to make and
then just set it up that way and allot this much money for everything and if we have any left
you know buy clothes or have fun go out to eat or something
and we're going to try to start saving
as soon as we can
we generally don't have a lot left over but as far as the long term our long-term goal is to
well my parents are both in their seventies my mother and stepfather and my father and stepmother are all in
father and stepmother are not in very good health so this is
it's a concern of yours right now is
yes it is
are they living independently right now
yes they are they are
oh have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that
not for them my mother and stepfather have
set up an arrangement where they have a large home and two of my sisters
are you
where are you calling from
i'm calling from miami
miami i'm in utah
utah well we've got a long distance connection tonight
yeah
yes it is definitely
you ready to start i am
sure go ahead
yeah
but on the other hand somebody you know making a couple of overdrawing checks probably isn't a major phenomena i
and it's hard to keep them honest when they're there for a long time
oh i think so too and i think that's about the only thing you can do to clean up government
well that bothers me because again we ought to have a government where we can choose who we want and
which is kind of a hard situation too
yeah but
have you been to washington
yes
actually i've had i've had very good luck on consumer products lately
um-hum
gotten recently it's been a new mother board for my computer and that's working fine
a new motherboard
yeah
okay
because my other one bit the dust after a power failure
yeah
so i got a you know a very inexpensive motherboard from someone in california very happy we were very fast
a little bit i have not have not done a lot of fishing in the last couple of years anyway
yeah
yeah
are old enough to play summer baseball and fall league basketball and that kind of stuff and man i just
yeah well mine are kids are both grown so that's past the point now where i can use them as
oh really
working and doing things around the house you know keeps you pretty busy anyway so
yeah
i tell you it really is hard to get time to go fishing you know unless you just
you don't at all
no and unfortunately it shows i
i'm supposed to i'm way overweight
but i've had a problem with high blood pressure which of course is directly connected to it and my doctor
um-hum
before i start in any exercising
or too much of it yeah you need
so anyway i did join the
the texans
well we needed you know something that was kind of convenient to
to getting you know because usually in the mornings things are pretty rushed
so that was a consideration
my wife and her mother went over to the
to the lady's house who keeps helen
and they you know before took her actually took her over but before
we signed up for it and
just kind of looked around you know and talked to her for awhile
watch how all the children the other children interacted with her and they all seemed to like her so we
maybe a higher grade one maybe the economics and the payback of having one at a business is a little
where people have nice three eighty six machines and nice graphics and the nice software packages and then when they
the slowness or the in some cases not even having a hard drive and that's pretty much where i fall
a variety of speeds and complexity of machines depending upon the instrument that it's controlling
and then i have one that i do just general purpose work on and then for the house i don't
would probably not be satisfied with anything less than a really nice one and that's a quite an expense and
commercial grade it's all where i guess you know to get something like wordperfect you're looking at five hundred dollars
and some of the accounting packages or the nicer spreadsheets are somewhat expensive and i don't know it's quite a
expense or a luxury for the house i guess and there's not a whole lot i would do other than
uh-huh
some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care
right
so it's a very it's a very comfortable i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you
right
the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected people's lives on in
oh really
because it's treated as a disease now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine
hum
well at my workplace they are we have places for aluminum cans and we have everybody's been issued a separate
recyclable paper let's see them get that word straight
uh-huh
as far as the community goes it's pretty much voluntary nothing's been done i don't where i live i live
and we don't have any we have just private garbage services and
yeah i it is it is to some degree inconvenient i'd have to say that
and it's not big enough it's kind of it's kind of silly and what you do is you put out
and that you put separately and you also put out in this little ridiculous container any cans or bottles you
hm
we do here see what do we recycle we they recycle they have bins
yeah
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and plastic bottles
and i think that's all they have
oh
what about you guys
well we there's a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i
uh-huh
but we've got a we've got a couple of different things places they're like unattended
i have several outside shrubs that i maintain take care of
um-hum do you enjoy working out in the yard
yeah i certainly do i planted a rosebed last year
um-hum
and they came out looking really nice lot of red and white ones pink
uh-huh i've had some roses out in my backyard too and they've done real well i was surprised
i we had some in virginia and they were real hard to keep up with but seems like they like
right yeah we built up our we built up boxes and put them in that so that they would drain
where i live do you live in texas or
